# Feedback Form for Github-Actions-Quickstart
The sequential instructions leave little room for error on the part of the demo-executor which I found helpful. But there is a point of ambiguity that might benefit from clarification. Specifically why we should create a "pull" request in step 4 when later it states that the workflow is executed on a push. I understand that hyperlinked docs expand more on the intricacies of the YAML file but some concise additions might be useful here.
